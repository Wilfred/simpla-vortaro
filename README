La Simpla Vortaro is a project to push what's possible with Esperanto
dictionaries.

The main areas of interest:
* built on Django
* simple, logical interface
* spell checking and orthography flexibility (unicode, x-system,
h-system)
* morphology analysis
* definitions courtesy of La Reta Vortaro

AGPLv3 licence, see COPYING for details.

Usage:

Need a dictionary.json generated by ReVo-utilities, copied to the
working directory.

Deployment:

Make sure you turn off debug in settings.py. Depending on your setup
on your server, you may also need to turn off logging in
